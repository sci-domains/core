# Secure Contract Interaction V1 (SCI)

The Secure Contract Interaction (SCI) Protocol is an open-source initiative aimed at enhancing security within the web3 ecosystem. It introduces a decentralized verification system allowing domain owners to authorize specific smart contracts to interact with their domains, thus minimizing risks associated with malicious contracts.

## Features

- **Decentralized Verification:** Verify contracts authorized to interact with specific domains.
- **Flexibility:** Easily integrate into wallets, security apps, and on-chain contracts.
- **Open-Source:** Free to use and contribute to, promoting transparency and collaboration.
- **Enhanced Security:** Protect users from interacting with malicious smart contracts.
