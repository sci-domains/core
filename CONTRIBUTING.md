## Contributing

In order to contribute, please fork off of the `main` branch and make your changes there. 
Your commit messages should detail why you made your change in addition to what you 
did (unless it is a tiny change).

If you need to pull in any changes from `main` after making your fork 
(for example, to resolve potential merge conflicts), 
please avoid using git merge and instead, git rebase your branch. 
This will help us review your change more easily.
Additionally, if you are writing a new feature, 
please ensure you add appropriate test cases under test/ (see below).


Please make sure you respect the coding style for this project.
You can run `yarn lint` for the linter and check the [solidity style guides](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/style-guide.html#) for more information
Also, even though we do CI testing, 
please test your code and ensure that it builds locally before submitting a pull request.

Thank you for your help!
